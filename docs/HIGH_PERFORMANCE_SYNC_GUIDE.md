## 🎯 Expected Performance

### Conservative Estimates

| System Spec | Expected Rate | Sync Time |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **High-end** (16+ cores, SSD, 32GB RAM) | 80-100 blocks/sec | ~68-55 hours |
| **Mid-range** (8 cores, SSD, 16GB RAM) | 50-70 blocks/sec | ~109-78 hours |
| **Basic** (4 cores, SSD, 8GB RAM) | 30-40 blocks/sec | ~182-137 hours |

### Factors Affecting Performance

**Positive Factors:**
- ✅ SSD storage for InfluxDB
- ✅ Local GLQ node (no network latency)
- ✅ High CPU core count
- ✅ Abundant RAM (16GB+)
- ✅ Fast internet connection
- ✅ Running during off-peak hours

**Limiting Factors:**
- ⚠️ HDD storage (slower writes)
- ⚠️ Remote RPC endpoint
- ⚠️ Limited CPU cores
- ⚠️ Low memory (swapping)
- ⚠️ Network congestion
- ⚠️ GLQ node performance

## 📈 Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Real-time Monitoring

The monitor shows:
- **Current sync rate** (blocks/sec)
- **Progress percentage**
- **ETA to completion**
- **System resource usage**
- **Performance history**

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### 1. Low Sync Rate (< 10 blocks/sec)

**Possible Causes:**
- GLQ node overloaded or slow
- Network connectivity issues
- Insufficient system resources
- Database write bottleneck

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Reduce concurrent requests if network is slow
# Edit fast_sync.py: self.concurrent_requests = 10

# Reduce batch size if memory limited
# Edit fast_sync.py: self.batch_size = 1000

# Check system resources
python monitor_sync.py
```

#### 2. High Error Rate

**Possible Causes:**
- RPC timeout issues
- Database connection problems
- Memory exhaustion

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check error logs in terminal output
# Reduce load if errors persist
# Verify GLQ node health
```

#### 3. Sync Stops/Crashes

**Possible Causes:**
- Memory exhaustion
- Database connection lost
- System resource limits

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Restart sync (it will resume from checkpoint)
python fast_sync.py

# Monitor resources
python monitor_sync.py
```

## 🔧 Advanced Tuning

### Custom Performance Settings

Edit `fast_sync.py` to customize:

```python
# Batch and concurrency settings
self.batch_size = 2000  # Blocks per batch
self.concurrent_requests = 20  # Parallel requests
self.checkpoint_interval = 5000  # Checkpoint frequency

# Connection pool settings  
self.connection_pool_size = 50
self.connection_timeout = 60
```

### System Optimization

**InfluxDB Optimization:**
```bash
# Increase InfluxDB memory
# Edit InfluxDB config:
# [storage]
# max-values-per-tag = 0
# max-series-per-database = 0
```

**OS-Level Optimization:**
```bash
# Increase file descriptor limits
ulimit -n 65536

# Optimize network settings
echo 'net.core.rmem_max = 268435456' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo 'net.core.wmem_max = 268435456' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```

## 🔄 Two-Phase Sync Strategy

For maximum efficiency, use a two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Fast Initial Sync (New Script)
```bash
# Optimize configuration
python optimize_config.py

# Run fast sync (basic block data only)
python fast_sync.py
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data Processing (Original Script)
```bash
# Restore configuration to enable analytics
python optimize_config.py restore

# Run enhanced sync for transaction details and analytics
python reset_and_sync.py
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. System Preparation
- Ensure at least 16GB RAM for optimal performance
- Use SSD storage for InfluxDB data directory
- Close unnecessary applications
- Run during off-peak network hours

### 2. Monitoring
- Keep monitor_sync.py running in separate terminal
- Watch for resource bottlenecks
- Monitor error rates

### 3. Resumption
- Sync automatically resumes from checkpoints
- Safe to stop/start as needed
- Checkpoints saved every 5,000 blocks

### 4. Post-Sync
- Restore original configuration
- Enable analytics for real-time processing
- Verify data integrity

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the monitor** - `python monitor_sync.py`
2. **Review error logs** in the terminal output
3. **Verify system resources** - ensure adequate CPU/RAM/disk
4. **Check GLQ node health** - ensure it's responsive
5. **Reduce load** - lower concurrent_requests or batch_size

Remember: The sync will automatically resume from checkpoints, so it's safe to stop and restart if needed.
